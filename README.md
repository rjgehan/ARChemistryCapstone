# ARChemistryCapstone

## Contributors
This project is a CS496 capstone project at Loyola University Maryland. The following students are working on this project:
- Ryan Gehan
- Peter Pressley

This project is developed in collaboration with Ms. Bal and Ms. Ure.

## Project Description
In this project we will create AR chemistry “Experiences”. A library of Exercises done in Augmented Reality that allow the user to
interact with elements and display how different chemical bonds are formed. These experiences will be accessible through a website we will be making so that the students are able
to examine these AR Experiences in one place.

Each experience is a small unity game that allows the user to move or "fly" around the game objects and will be able to interact with them to make the objects display themselves combining.
