            Chemicals react together to form new products. There are some patterns in the way chemicals react which
            allows some predictions to be made and these patterns can be used later in stoichiometric calculations. The
            experiences shown here are examples of 4 different types of reactions. There are many more that should be
            explored to gain a full understanding of the topic, but these will help to turn the experiments you have
            seen into the atomic rearrangements that are shown in equations.

                Neutralizations</button>
        </div>
        This acid base neutralization example showcases a metal hydroxide reacting with an acid in a neutralization
        reaction. The products are a metal salt and water. At the atomic level it can be seen that the Na+ and Cl- ions
        remain in the solution whilst it is the H+ and OH- ions that actually react and form water. Other acid base
        neutralization reactions include acids reacting with a metal carbonate, and a metal oxide.

                Reaction</button>
        </div>
        The synthesis reaction example shown here is magnesium burning in air. This reaction could be classified as a
        combustion reaction as well. The elements are combining to form a white ash that is a reaction between magnesium
        cations and oxide anions.

                Decomposition</button>
        </div>
        The thermal decomposition example given here is the heating of copper carbonate. This is often used as an
        example in class because of the extreme color change from the green carbonate to the black oxide product. The
        heat causes the less stable carbonate ion to break up releasing carbon dioxide which can be tested for by
        bubbling through lime water, which will go cloudy. The remaining oxide ion stays with the copper ion forming the
        black copper oxide product.

            <button onclick="window.open('https://app.vectary.com/p/4FkUlXnoXoS0DAcaeEmlyY', '_blank')">Single
                Displacements</button>
        </div>
        Single displacement reactions are very easy to predict provided the metal reactivity series is used to compare
        the solo metal and the metal in the salt. If the solo metal is more reactive it will displace the less reactive
        metal from the solution. This visualizes as the more reactive metal disappearing and another metal appearing.
        The atomic level interaction shows the example where the magnesium metal displaces the less reactive copper. The
        reverse reaction would not take place as copper is less reactive than magnesium.
