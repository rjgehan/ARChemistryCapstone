            Reactions take place when reactant particles collide with each other. There are several methods that can be
            used to control the way these collisions take place and the resulting speed of reaction. A few of the key
            controlling methods are explained in the experiences below. The only one missing is pressure which applies
            only to gases.
        <div class="button-container">
            <button onclick="window.open('https://app.vectary.com/p/5z5cGpdLuLVThKka74m5Dq', '_blank')">Collision
                Theory</button>
        </div>
        For any reaction to take place the reactant particles must collide with the right amount of force and with the
        particles in the correct orientation. The example shown here is a general example, but the concepts apply to all
        reactions. Controlling the speed and number of these collisions in turn, controls the rate of the reaction.
        <div class="button-container">
            <button onclick="window.open('https://app.vectary.com/p/7HoioSmn2He9uhzzHJZAHg', '_blank')">Temperature
                Change</button>
        </div>
        Changing the temperature of of reactions works for fluids (liquids, solutions, and gases). Adding heat energy results in an
        increase in kinetic energy of the particles. If the particles are moving more and moving faster, there is a
        greater chance of a collision, so the rate of reaction will increase. There are some exceptions to this, but the
        majority of reactions speed up when they are warmed. In this temperature change experience, you can see stylized
        particles reacting in a warm and cold environment. Watch to see which reaction finishes first.
        <div class="button-container">
            <button
                onclick="window.open('https://app.vectary.com/p/1Ff5Pp5P0KzD0bnK2bVUTM', '_blank')">Concentration</button>
        </div>
        Changing concentration applies to liquids and solutions. An increase in concentration means there are more
        reactant particles present in the reaction vessel. If there are more particles present the chances of a
        collision resulting in a reaction are increased. In this concentration experience you can see stylized particles
        reacting in both a high and low concentration solution. Watch to see which reaction finishes first.
        <div class="button-container">
            <button>Surface Area (link coming)</button>
        </div>
        By grinding up a solid into smaller pieces, the surface area increases. The same mass and number of particles
        are present in both situations but because more of them are exposed in the smaller pieces, more collisions can
        take place and so the reaction speeds up.
        <div class="button-container">
            <button>Catalyst (link coming)</button>
        </div>
        Catalysts reduce the activation energy (the energy required to get a reaction started). Catalysts provide an
        alternative, lower energy pathway for the reaction to occur and causes it to speed up. Catalysts tend to be
        specific to a reaction and inorganic catalysts are often from the transition metal section of the periodic
        table. One key thing about inorganic catalysts is that they are not used up in the reaction as they are not a
        reactant; they can be reused again and again.
